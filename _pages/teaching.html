Currently, I mainly teach classes on statistical programming and statistical learning in the [Econometrics Master Programme](https://www.eur.nl/en/master/econometrics) and in the [Data Science and Marketing Analytics Master](https://www.eur.nl/en/master/data-science-and-marketing-analytics) at Erasmus University Rotterdam. I am also the master thesis coordinator of the [Business Analytics and Quantitative Marketing](https://www.eur.nl/en/master/business-analytics-and-quantitative-marketing) track of the Econometrics programme. Additionally, I teach a PhD course at [Erasmus Graduate School of the Scocial Sciences and Humanities](https://www.eur.nl/en/egsh). Here, I focus more on the statistical analysis capabilities of R (i.e., univariate, grouped and nested as well as multivariate models).
