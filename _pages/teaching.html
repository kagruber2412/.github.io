Currently, I mainly teach classes on <b>statistical programming</b> and <b>statistical learning</b> in the 
<a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/master/econometrics">Econometrics Master Programme</a> and in the 
<a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/master/data-science-and-marketing-analytics">Data Science and Marketing Analytics Master</a>
at Erasmus University Rotterdam. Additionally, I teach a PhD course at 
<a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/egsh">Erasmus Graduate School of the Scocial Sciences and Humanities</a>. 
<!--
Here, I focus on the statistical analysis capabilities of the R programming environment (i.e., univariate, grouped and nested as well as multivariate models).
