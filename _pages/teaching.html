Currently, I mainly teach classes on statistical programming and statistical learning in the 
<a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/master/econometrics">Econometrics Master Programme</a> and in the 
<a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/master/data-science-and-marketing-analytics">Data Science and Marketing Analytics Master</a>
at Erasmus University Rotterdam. Additionally, I teach a PhD course at 
<a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/egsh">Erasmus Graduate School of the Scocial Sciences and Humanities</a>. 
Here, I focus on the statistical analysis capabilities of the R programming environment (i.e., univariate, grouped and nested as well as multivariate models).

I have supervised numerous BSc and MSc theses on the following topics: 
(1) feature attribution methods (LIME, Lift, Shapley Values), 
(2) uncertainty quantification with probabilistic neural networks and deep ensembles, 
(3) Bayesian estimation of large scale/ high dimensional panel regression models.
I am also the master thesis coordinator of the 
<a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/master/business-analytics-and-quantitative-marketing">Business Analytics and Quantitative Marketing</a>
track of the Econometrics programme.
