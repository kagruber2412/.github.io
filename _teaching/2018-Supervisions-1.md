A large part of my current teaching duties involves supervisions of BSc. and MSc. theses. The MSc. theses have a strong applied component: students either do an internship at a company or write their thesis on a topic related to my ongoing research. (In this context, my supervision work can be considered similar to a consulting task.) 

Currently, I am co-promoting the Ph.D. student Markus M\"uller together with Prof. Dr. Dennis Fok on \textbf{Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Neural Networks} for mixed type tabular data. We use this type of generative models in the context of missing data imputation, for predictions on high dimensional (and sparse) categorical data, and for the design of simulation tools.
