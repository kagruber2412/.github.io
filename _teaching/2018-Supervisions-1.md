I am co-promoting the PhD student Markus Mueller together with Prof. Dr. Dennis Fok on [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Neural Networks for mixed type tabular data](url) (second year).

In the past, I have also supervised numerous BSc and MSc theses on the following topics: (1) feature attribution methods (LIME, Lift, Shapley Values), (2) uncertainty quantification with probabilistic neural networks and deep ensembles, (3) Bayesian estimation of large scale/ high dimensional panel regression models.
