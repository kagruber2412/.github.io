During my Phd time at WU Vienna University of Business and Economics, I also had quite some teaching duties: I designed and provided several courses on statistical analysis and statistical programming in the marketing [master](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/marketing/teaching/master-program/) and [bachelor](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/marketing/teaching/sbwls/) specialisations.
