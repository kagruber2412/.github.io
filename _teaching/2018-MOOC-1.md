* Building Response Models in R [[Course Overview](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/building-response-models-in-r)]
-->

I have designed a Datacamp course on [Building Response Models in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/building-response-models-in-r). In this course, you learn to uncover patterns of marketing actions and customer reactions in a series of interactive coding challenges and tutorials. In particular, you will learn how to quantify the impact of marketing variables, such as price and different promotional tactics, using aggregate sales and individual-level choice data.
