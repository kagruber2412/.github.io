Currently, I mainly teach classes on statistical programming and statistical learning in the [Econometrics Master Programme](https://www.eur.nl/en/master/econometrics) and in the [Data Science and Marketing Analytics Master](https://www.eur.nl/en/master/data-science-and-marketing-analytics) at Erasmus University Rotterdam. I am also the master thesis coordinator of the [Business Analytics and Quantitative Marketing](https://www.eur.nl/en/master/business-analytics-and-quantitative-marketing) track of the Econometrics programme. Additionally, I teach a Ph.D. course at [Erasmus Graduate School of the Scocial Sciences and Humanities](https://www.eur.nl/en/egsh). Here, I focus more on the statistical analysis capabilities of R (i.e., univariate, grouped and nested as well as multivariate models).<br> The full list of past and present courses can be found below. Syllabi and course descriptions can be accessed via the embedded links. Feel free to disseminate any of the available course material.
