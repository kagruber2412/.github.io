As in previous years, Albert Heijn’s Data Science department partnered with Erasmus University Rotterdam in a 10-week case study course. Thereby, students of the Econometrics Masters Programme are tasked with applying their knowledge to real-world scenarios. For students in the Business Analytics and Quantitative Marketing specialisation, the case study focused on improving Albert Heijn’s loyalty programme, known as Mijn Bonus Box. The students worked in teams of four to develop their ideas and solutions over the course of ten weeks. The proposed solutions and models of all teams are highly impressive and contribute to new insights which can be utilised by the AH Data Science department.
