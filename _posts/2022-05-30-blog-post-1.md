As in previous years, [Albert Heijn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Heijn)’s Data Science department partnered with [Erasmus University Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/en) for the 10-week case study course in the [Econometrics Mastser Programme](https://www.eur.nl/en/master/econometrics/programme-overview). For students in the Business Analytics and Quantitative Marketing specialisation, the case study focused on improving Albert Heijn’s loyalty programme, known as [Mijn Bonus Box](https://www.ah.nl/acties/bonusbox). Under my guidance the students developed their ideas and models in teams of four. The proposed solutions of all teams are highly impressive and the generated insights are utilised by the AH Data Science department.

The full blog post with the case study summary can be read on [Medium](https://blog.ah.technology/attention-based-neural-networks-in-recommender-systems-albert-heijn-erasmus-university-case-study-4de9dbb02e8e) and is written by one of the teams, consisting of Otto Haanappel, Yasmin Levens, Thomas van Esch and Anne van Voorthuijsen.
