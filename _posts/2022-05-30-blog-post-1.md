As in previous years, [Albert Heijn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Heijn)’s Data Science department partnered with Erasmus University Rotterdam for the 10-week case study course in the [Econometrics Mastser Programme](https://www.eur.nl/en/master/econometrics/programme-overview). For students in the Business Analytics and Quantitative Marketing specialisation, the case study focused on improving Albert Heijn’s loyalty programme, known as [Mijn Bonus Box](https://www.ah.nl/acties/bonusbox). In teams of four, the students developed their ideas and models under the guidance of Dr. Kathrin Gruber. The proposed solutions of all teams are highly impressive and the insights can be utilised by the AH Data Science department.
