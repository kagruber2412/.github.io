As in previous years, [Albert Heijn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Heijn)’s Data Science department partnered with [Erasmus University Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/en) for the 10-week case study course in the [Econometrics Master Programme](https://www.eur.nl/en/master/econometrics/programme-overview). The case goal was to improve Albert Heijn’s loyalty programme, known as [Mijn Bonus Box](https://www.ah.nl/acties/bonusbox). The students of the Business Analytics and Quantitative Marketing specialisation developed their ideas and models in teams of four under my guidance. All proposed solutions are highly impressive and the generated insights are utilised by the AH Data Science department.

The full blog post with the case study summary can be read on [Medium](https://blog.ah.technology/attention-based-neural-networks-in-recommender-systems-albert-heijn-erasmus-university-case-study-4de9dbb02e8e) and is written by one of the teams, consisting of Otto Haanappel, Yasmin Levens, Thomas van Esch and Anne van Voorthuijsen.
