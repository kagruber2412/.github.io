As in previous years, Albert Heijn’s Data Science department partnered with Erasmus University Rotterdam to offer Econometrics Masters students the opportunity to participate in a 10-week case study course. As part of this programme, students were tasked with applying their knowledge to real-world scenarios presented by Albert Heijn. For students in the Business Analytics and Quantitative Marketing specialisation, the case study focused on improving Albert Heijn’s loyalty programme, known as Mijn Bonus Box.

Under the guidance of Dr. Kathrin Gruber, the students worked in teams of four to develop their ideas and solutions over the course of ten weeks. Throughout this period, they presented their progress and final findings to Albert Heijn. The proposed solutions and models of all teams are highly impressive and contribute to new insights which can be utilised by the AH Data Science department.

This blog is written by one of the teams, consisting of Otto Haanappel, Yasmin Levens, Thomas van Esch and Anne van Voorthuijsen, and summarises the case study and their findings.
